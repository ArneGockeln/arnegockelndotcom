<h2>Standing Invitation</h2>
<p>In 2018 I moved to Hamburg and every day I look forward to new discoveries and contacts. I am always interested in meeting new people and exchanging ideas. So here's my suggestion: if you feel like talking to me about startups, software development or algorithmic trading, then I invite you to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Especially if you are in Hamburg! Then I would also like to meet you personally. The first cup of tea or coffee is on me!</p>
