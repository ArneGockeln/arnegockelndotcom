I have made my great passion, software development, my profession. Furthermore, I am engaged in the development of algorithmic trading systems and software in the financial markets.

Since the year 2000 I have been on the road as a founder and freelancer. During this time I have gained a lot of experience in applied software development in the Unix and Web environment, in Linux system administration, in the Open Source area and since 2011 as a Forex trader.

I love the open source world and everything related to it. Mainly I work with macOS and debian Linux. My preferred programming languages are C/C++, PHP and Bash. I like to use the Qt framework to develop GUI applications, but I'm also a fan of ncurses, bash scripting and command line programs. 

In 2019 I decided to share my knowledge and meet with other great algorithmic adventurers. So I founded the [Algorithmic/Quantitative Trading Hamburg](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Algorithmic-Quantitative-Trading-Hamburg){:target="_blank"} Meetup. I would be happy to see you there!
