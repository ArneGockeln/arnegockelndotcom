I was born 1982 in Herdecke, Germany and grew up in Dortmund. At the age of 7-8 I started my journey as a software developer by changing code fragments in the computer games I was playing. This is where everything starts. I was so excited that I could change the color and behavior of the soldiers only by changing some values in an ini file. That was awesome!

So I started to learn basic on DOS 6.22 and right after that C on linux. Between 10 to 18 I developed computer games, software tools and got into the world of the world wide web.  

I broke school and started my first software company. It started as a huge success but ended in a disaster. Well, lesson learned. 

To get rid of my debt, I took every software developer job that I could get. That was the best thing I could do, because I learned so much in real world projects and build my skills as a software developer. All the things that you can't learn in school or at a university. Just learning by doing. 

In 2011 I crossed the financial trading world by visiting my Dad and a friend of him. This friend made a fortune in stocks and was very enthusiastic about his new live. This kind of concept to earn money inspired me to investigate further, but at that time I was into video game and web development also. 

## The New World

Because I love new challenges, some years later I graduated in 3d game development and a second graduation in C/C++ system development on the linux platform. At this point I came at crossroads and had to decide which way I want to go. On one hand the fascinating world of computer game development or on the other by trading the financial markets.

I made a SWOT analysis for myself and decided to deep dive into the world of the financial markets. From now on I read books and websites about technical and fundamental analysis, indicators and oscillators, multiple timeframe analysis, trading platforms, micro economics, trading psychology and made my first steps as a trader with a micro account in the forex market. But man, it was so boring for me to sit in front of several charts to wait for the next entry signal which is why I started to ask myself if this is the right way for me to trade the markets. 

Questions like "*What is the smallest timeframe to trade?*" or "*How many quotes are inside a one minute candle?*" or "*What can I do with all my gained knowledge about applied software development?*" or "**Am I able to build a high performance signal algorithm which trades for me?**" The latter did not let go of me anymore. So I decided to stop trading manually and start to learn everything about algorithmic trading. I invested a lot of time, money and discipline to get there. 

On my way I came across very fascinating new topics like the high frequency trading (HFT) world, higher mathematics, trading protocols like FIX (Financial Information Exchange), order and price management systems, quantitative analysis, performance optimizations, algorithmic trading strategies and so on and on. I love it! 

In 2017 I decided to change from a freelance software developer to a full time algorithmic trader, but I needed some time to switch. 2018 I moved to Hamburg and started as a passionate full time algorithmic trader.

## Why another blog?

First things first: I love what I do and I want to work with other like mindet adventureres. Also I didn't get where I am now by only buying online courses or reading expensive trading books. I want to share my practical knowledge and experience, which is growing every single day. I plan to write about at least to main topics like applied software development and algorithmic trading. And because I am a big fan of linux and macOS the content of this website is dedicated to such systems.

I am dreaming about a single blog which helps you to get into the world of software development and algorithmic trading on top.  

Also I am always interested in meeting new people all over the world and discuss interesting topics. Feel free to [contact]({{ site.url }}/contact.html) me!

I am looking forward to this journey!

Arne.
