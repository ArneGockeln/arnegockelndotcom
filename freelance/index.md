So you are interested in working with me? That sounds good! 

If it has something to do with **software development**, then I am interested too.
I have more than **19 years experience** as a **professional software and web developer** and as a freelancer. In the past I worked in small and big  projects, some as a one man solution, most of them as a team player. In all of them we worked agile by using the Kanban method.

I can support you as a **backend software developer** 3-4 days per week on site in Hamburg (Germany) or 100% remote (World Wide), which I prefer. 

## Projects

This is a list of some of my past client projects:

- WordPress Plugin Development
- WordPress API Development
- Custom Software Development
- Jekyll Static Site Development
- Web Performance Optimization
- QuickFIX Price Management Engine Development

That is what I can help you with! What I can not help you with is all kind of frontend development. I am not a designer or web-designer! All I do is text related and in most cases happens in the background, which you as a user do not see. This is why it's called **backend software developer**.
