## Standing Invitation

In 2018 I moved to **Hamburg &#9875;** and every day I look forward to new discoveries and contacts. I am always interested in meeting new people and exchanging ideas. So here's my suggestion: if you feel like talking to me about business and software development, then I invite you to get in touch with me.

Especially if you are in Hamburg! Then I would also like to meet you personally. The first cup of tea or coffee is on me!

You can shoot me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40arnegockeln) or by good old email: sayhi@gockeln.com.
